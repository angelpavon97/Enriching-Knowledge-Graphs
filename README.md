# Enriching-Knowledge-Graphs
Technical project ’Enriching semantics using Language Models’ from ISWS 2022 assisted by Paul Groth.

 Ángel Pavón, asif hashmat, Elena Volkanovska, Joana Vieira Paulino, Youssra Rebboud.
 
 The main goal of this project is enriching wikidata with a new methos of link prediction. Which relies on masked language models Namely GPT3, XLMRoberta, and Bert. 
 
 The other contribution is enrich entities of wikidata with their different alises and their descriptions, which improved the precision og the predicted relation by the pretrained language models.
